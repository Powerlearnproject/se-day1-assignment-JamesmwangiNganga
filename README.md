Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software Engineering is the art of designing, developing, testing and mainatining software applications and systems. 
Importances are as the following.
Aids in building reliable, efficient, and scalable software applications/systems.
Breaks down large projects into manageable tasks.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answeer: Birth of software enegineering - 1968
         Introduction of waterfall method in the 1970s
         Agile manifesto in the early 2000


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
Gather and define the project’s needs.
Define project scope, budget, and timelines.
Create architecture and system design.
Developing, Writing and compiling of code.
Identify and fix software defects.
Deployment of the software/system
Maintenance to Provide updates and bug fixes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process, making it ideal for projects with fixed requirements, such as construction or government contracts. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments, making it well-suited for software development or fast-changing industries like startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
1. Software Developer
Writes and maintains code.
Implements system design and functionality.
Debugs and optimizes software performance.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Designs and executes test cases.
Identifies and reports bugs.
Ensures software meets functional and performance standards.
3. Project Manager
Oversees project execution and timelines.
Manages resources and team collaboration.
Ensures project goals align with business objectives.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: An IDE is a software suite that provides developers with tools to write, test, and debug code efficiently. It combines a code editor, compiler/interpreter, and debugger into one application
        Examples of IDEs:
        Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 
    A VCS is a tool that tracks changes to code over time, allowing developers to collaborate and revert to previous versions if necessary.
    Examples of VCS:
    Git – Most widely used, supported by platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
**Importance of VCS in Software Development**
Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project.
Version Tracking – Keeps a history of all code changes.
**Importance of IDEs in Software Development:**
Increases Productivity – Provides auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools.
Reduces Errors – Helps identify and fix bugs quickly.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by software engineers are:
1. Fatigue and excessive screen time, this can be solved by doing a single task at a time and taking rest between tasks.
2. Meeting tight deadlines, this can be by using Agile methodologies to break tasks into smaller sprints.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
#Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., functions or methods).
Importance: Catches bugs early and ensures each unit works as expected.
#Integration Testing – Tests interactions between different modules.
Importance: Ensures data flows correctly between components.
#System Testing – Tests the entire system as a whole.
Importance: Validates that all components work together in real-world scenarios.
#Acceptance Testing – Verifies whether the software meets business requirements.
Importance: Ensures the product is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting well-structured inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about Humans."

Improved Prompt:
"Provide an overview of the history of Humans, including key achievements and their evolution history."
